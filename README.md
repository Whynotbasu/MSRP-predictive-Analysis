# 🚗 Car Pricing & Product Strategy Optimization with Data Science

> **Drive profitability and innovation by using data to design the right cars for the right market.**

---

## 📌 Overview

With the rise of electric vehicles and growing competition, manufacturers need to make smarter decisions about **what to build** and **how to price it**. This project analyzes a real-world car dataset to:

✅ Predict optimal pricing using car specifications  
✅ Identify high-demand and high-profit segments  
✅ Recommend the perfect car configuration for today’s market

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

> 💡 *“How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting evolving consumer demand?”*

This analysis uses EDA, regression, and clustering to provide actionable insights for manufacturers navigating a fast-changing automotive landscape.

## 📈 Key Takeaways

### 🔋 Fuel Trends
- **Regular and Premium unleaded fuels** dominate today’s market
- **Electric & hybrid vehicles** show a clear upward trend

### 🚘 Vehicle Styles
- **SUVs and Sedans** are the most popular styles
- **Luxury trims** show strong MSRP and consumer interest

### ⚙️ Price Drivers
- Key features impacting MSRP: **Engine HP**, **Fuel Type**, **Vehicle Style**

### 🧠 Market Segmentation
- 3 key buyer clusters identified:
  - Budget daily drivers
  - Family-friendly sedans/SUVs
  - Tech-forward premium vehicles

---

## 🏁 Final Recommendation

> ✅ **Build This Car**:

- 🚙 **Mid-sized Premium SUV**  
- 🔋 **Plug-in Hybrid or Electric**  
- ⚙️ **200–250 HP | 4–6 Cylinders**

## 🧪 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values using **median** (numeric) and **mode** (categorical)
- Dropped sparsely filled columns like `Market Category`

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Created `Avg MPG` as a combined efficiency metric  
- Categorized fuel types (e.g. Premium, Electric, Flex-Fuel)

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature trends using bar charts, box plots, heatmaps  
- Analyzed price variation across fuel types and styles

### 4️⃣ Predictive Modeling
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model to estimate MSRP  
- Used feature importance to guide product decisions

### 5️⃣ Market Segmentation
- Used **KMeans Clustering** to group vehicles into buyer personas  
- Identified ideal targets for price tiers and product development
